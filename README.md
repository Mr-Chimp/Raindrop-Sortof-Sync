# Raindrop-Sortof-Sync
A chrome extension that sort of syncs with Raindrop, so it doesn't sync at all but what it does do is let you copy Raindrops from a Raindrop.io collection over to a local bookmark folder in your browser. It has built in rate limiting to stick within Raindrop.io's rate limits.

I do not intend to develop this into a full sync extension but will fix bugs if any arise.

Known Bugs
- The text that updates during sync to let you know what is going on doesn't run correctly at the end of the fetching process which it should do
